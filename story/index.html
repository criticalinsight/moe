Not the one that left splinters in your heart that grew to become thorns as you held onto a home that had flown away from you. Tell me of the love that raises the corners of your lips as you flip through the memories like a moving gallery. Of a love that keeps you hoping, a love that draws out little ponds from your eyes, and not waterfalls. Perhaps the kind of love felt between a mother and child, between family, between friends. how lucky you must have felt to have them around whenever their presence healed the wounds underneath your skin. Let me know that even with the right person, everything could go wrong. Tell me of the words left unsaid, the pieces of the story left to fade away. There are paradises scribbled between lines and across margins, over and under places they do not belong, and to leave them in the dust would be to have tasted only quarter of of the good pieces to this darkness. Say something to me. Quieten this silence of yours. Fill these empty spaces with your words, no matter how insignificant you claim them to be. I once tasted too much of the universe that lingered on your lips, consumed more than I planned of those woven around your words, and from the moment you sought out to find a new home, I wilt from thirst. And when it comes to you, I’m at a loss for words. my greatest treasures melt into the nothingness as you approach me like a tornado in May; so sudden, so unexpected. except light and life don’t depart at your homecoming, and the nirvana I melt myself in has never felt a presence more familiar.
