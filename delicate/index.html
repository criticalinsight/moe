                     <p>there’s a bottle beating back against rocky shores, a delicate enclosure keeping prisoner a letter of all the words held back. words that never thrived, and eventually, faded as they lingered on crumpled sheets, splattered about the cracks  on the wall above our heads—the constellations in our ceilings, our own little night sky—traced skylines and stayed hidden in a little corner of a wall. There are moments when they yearn to have the taste of freedom lingering on their chapped lips, calling out to dry land to reach closer, to escape the displeased waves they fall deeper and deeper into. But the fear-my fear- of the sudden surge of pain that would be felt after they climb out of this dark abyss of theirs holds them back. They enrage the water that surrounds them, and are drawn back with the furious ebb of the ever growing tides
freedom now sings for these words of mine. They flee from the crippling aura of darkness into warm citron rays. But these words are late, far too late.
you’ve drawn back into a world farther away from my reach. a different sky looks down upon you, and the wind coasting down hills that my feet remain yet to mark, stretching stalks of flowers I haven’t yet caressed has never called away the heat from my skin. these words of mine call out to a darkening oasis; a letter sent to a sailor after he’s been swallowed by the ocean, a kiss settled on the cheek of a rotting corpse; I have come to a cross-roads whose paths lead into a dark greenwood.
To have travelled this far in hopes of meeting a brighter sun, only to run into the arms of your absence spawns a bewildering pain, much greater than what was once felt. And I feel a hundred more bottles springing up from the waters, more remnants of anguish scribbled on every corner of the sheet rolled up within their glass walls.
And I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to hold them back; they will flood my very being until there’ll be nothing to do but set them free and welcome rushing waves of torment.
Maybe one day these words will find their way to you.</p>
