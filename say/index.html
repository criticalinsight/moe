What would I tell them what happiness will mean? What sorrow can taste like? Will I tell them that nothing on this earth will ever feel as much like home, as much like grace and as much like pure and absolute contentment than being woken in the stillness of a dark night, rolling over, adjusting your pillow and without warning, feeling the side of your foot brush the warmth of a leg that connects to a hip, a hip that gives way to a stomach and supports a chest, a chest that protects a heart that you know, without doubt, belongs to you. That happiness is handing over your heart, knowing that it is in capable hands; hands that want to hold it and will not tremble at the sight of it leaking out and spilling onto their clothes. That love, true love, is not seeing flaws in them, but explanations and reasons and meanings to the things they hide and spend so much time concerned over. It’s loving the pieces they waste their moments hiding. What would be written of sorrow? Why don’t they explain the emptiness that comes when one hand fills the gap and it belongs to one person that you waited a lifetime to find and that finding doesn’t mean getting them, and loving them doesn’t mean holding them, and holding them doesn’t mean keeping them, and waiting doesn’t mean you will wait numb to the loneliness and oxygen stealing burning of tired lungs? Why don’t they tell us of the wounds we will incur and the depth they will sink into us, and why don’t they tell us that we will forever cherish the stars created? —tyler knott gregson ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Moe"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Moe"}}</script>
