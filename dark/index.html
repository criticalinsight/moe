                     <p>They drove for hours to the ocean,
Just for the proof that they had been,
Then watched the sunset’s splendid colors,
Through the pixels of a screen,
Left before the sky had darkened,
And the night had learnt their names,
With their fingers tapping light, 
That would have put the moon’s to shame, 
Ten billion stars all tried to stop them, 
To beg that they should see more, 
Instead of sleeping in hotels, 
That boast the fact that they have four, 
But their only constellations, 
Were the cracks across their ceiling, 
As they sent their one-word answers, 
As a substitute for feelings, 
And with the traffic as a soundtrack, 
They soon drifted off to sleep, 
And didn’t even slightly stir, 
When all the clouds began to weep
