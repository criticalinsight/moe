Will their skin prickle at the darkness that holds them too close? Will their bones echo out songs of despair and cry out at the urge to let it out when it all becomes too much to bear? Or will this quiet be in their favor and cocoon them in warmth, even if temporary, drying out the waves of misery that drown them each night. How they wished there wasn’t a dark side to moments like this, that immediately the moon appeared in the sky and the sun carefully sank into the abyss of the sea, all their worries and pieces of unhappiness, however little, would simply disappear with the light. That they’d never have to walk along the riverbed of regret, or find themselves in the forest of reminisce, or lost in the vineyards of uncertainty, but skyrocket into the creases of dark space until morning comes again.
