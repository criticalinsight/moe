                     <p>You are a mirror, so you mirror. Show me who I am, where I come from, and where I intend to take you—as if you have no legs of your own. No sense of direction. No light. No aptitude. No form. No shape of your own—you are water. And you have taken me to be your vessel. But I see you. I see you be me, and give me back what I give you. Hand me lines I tell you in my dreams. Promise me love that you expect from me—you think you are heavy. But you are heavy with my burden. You reflect my own light back at me and there is not a lot of which I own. It is always dark when we kiss. Eyes closed with surrender. Only pause and hesitance. </p>
<p>Indecision in me is indecision in you. Cravings in me are cravings in you. No desire of your own. Only banality. Only want. To show what is seen. To be what is needed. To talk what needs to be said. Only cause and no effect. Only battle and no blood shed. Only dying and death. Only prosecution. Only pain. Only reflection. Only shame.</p>
