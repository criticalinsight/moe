Something dispiriting about the clearing of the frost-layered earth and silvery trees, the parting of the snowflake-sky and wintry breeze. As if the earth’s moved on and left me behind, still staggering in snowstorms of yesterdays, while she clears away the silver mists of the winter and makes lush jungles of her prairies again; asters and lilies rooting up from her crevices, flush, fresh leaf buds growing on the once bare and brittle branches of the once dead trees. And there comes the summer of sun, endless weeks of golden light and warmth stepping forth from Birth. The same sun that sent new green leaves bursting from blackened buds now turn the wands of knee high grasses golden. Yet, she bores down on me hotter and harder than before, as if mocking me of the little light left inside of me, a striking difference to the infinite beams she holds–she is.
