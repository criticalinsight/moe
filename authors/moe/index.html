                  <p>here comes the intimate moments, the fleeting moments of euphoria I could never bottle but only yearn for; and between long sighs and songs of silence, what is it we speak of? a language, a language far older than time itself, words that have never met paper, words that have never climbed out of our throats and rolled off of our tongues but bellow within the walls of our minds and, during moments of comfort and intimacy, of soft touches and flowery caresses, of the brush of fingers and gazes locked flood every inch of soul. and as it is far too overwhelming, all there is to do is sigh and enjoy such fleeting moments, a paradise commanded to root up from earth by the mere trace of fingers over skin, of warm eyes and even warmer embraces, embraces I needn’t ask for, of quiet whispers and high notes, the intimacy of immaculate songs at the earliest moments of the morning. </p>

                  <p>I am one of the searchers. There are, I believe, millions of us. We are not unhappy, but neither are we really content. We continue to explore life, hoping to uncover its ultimate secret. We continue to explore ourselves, hoping to understand. We like to walk along the beach, we are drawn by the ocean, taken by its power, its unceasing motion, its mystery and unspeakable beauty. We like forests and mountains, deserts and hidden rivers, and the lonely cities as well. Our sadness is as much a part of our lives as is our laughter. To share our sadness with one we love is perhaps as great a joy as we can know - unless it be to share our laughter. We searchers are ambitious only for life itself, for everything beautiful it can provide. Most of all we love and want to be loved. We want to live in a relationship that will not impede our wandering, nor prevent our search, nor lock us in prison walls; that will take us for what little we have to give. We do not want to prove ourselves to another or compete for love. For wanderers, dreamers, and lovers, for lonely men and women who dare to ask of life everything good and beautiful. It is for those who are too gentle to live among wolves. —James Kavanaugh, There Are Men Too Gentle To Live Among Wolves </p>

                  <p>golden globe, I weep for you. The salt inhabited pools that deprive of me clear sight are dedicated to you, as I spend countless silent nights staring at the golden rays you bestow upon that mere rock your flames ablaze for. I will not deny it, I am at fault. I preferred to have my being glistening and dripping wet in crystal light and found your lemon beams a curse, bearing an acidity that ate at my flesh until all that was left was soulless bone. I begged for the sky to be darkened and showered with those white spots of magnificence, and in the center of that breathtaking infinity, the celestial you endlessly boil harder for. mother of stars, heed my call. let my sorrows echo throughout the ever growing realm you dwell in and awaken your kin, for they too need to hear this unraveling of mine. they too need to realize that they worship who must not be totally worshipped, that they have their backs turned on she who brings forth all this beauty; it is your own embodiment that gives life to the arch of beauty that brightens up a mighty deluge, signifying the island of bliss and contentment that erupts only after a shipwreck. But it has taken a near eternity to have myself dawned in the already known truth. you are the spark that lightens up our blackened souls and perishes away the darkness, and from that burning light grew the flowers, even if not many, that encircle our concealed edges. yet you are loved by few. and yet your adoration for we underlings does not flicker. —Sun, with these words I give you my all. </p>

                  <p> a freckled lilac sky lies awake above your head, tonight. what are stars are now flaming, white spots growing larger moment by moment, flickering in the ocean-filled eyes that stare up at them. the dandelions in the evening wind always mocked you behind your back because you could only reach so far, like a leaf bound to the branch of a tree, only free from it when October closes down on the burning heat of summer, but the passing of the comets as their thin streaks of light left traces of ethereal beauty in the velvety-blue sky melted away their scornful gazes. there’s a secret underneath those otherworldly folds. a rhythm to the beam of the moon, the shimmering of the stars and soul-stirring gleam of the northern lights. a symphony to the dance of this mass of green I lay back on, the soft whispers of the breeze and howling of the gales. the quivering of the leaves, the ebb and flow of the ocean tides. “maybe the sea carries our dreams, and we all wait for the salt to soak into our ankles, when instead, we should be out there dancing with the waves” </p>

                  <p>Take me to the cold mornings and the breath that rises, sunrises on snowy streets, to the coffee in your hands, to the paint under your fingernails from the logo on the styrofoam. To the sand covered shores and tide poles that hold the sea, to the sea that holds the moon and he starts that fall until you sleep. Take me to our shared slumber on scratchy sheets starched too stiff. Take me to the cheap hotels and take me to palaces we’ll never afford. Take me to the nights that never end, the lost and wander worn feet that collapse into bed as the sun is rising. Take me to the early evenings, tired legs sleeping sound before the sun falls below the hills. Take me our places, the creaking floors and our boots making songs stop them. The dim lit pubs and fiddle dances, the globe lights low, the hour long talks, the quiet romances. Take me down the old dirt roads, the rocks walls and clover greases. To the green and the grey to the blue and the white. Take me to our places, the stones and sticks in green hills. Take me to the rooftops made of earth. The heather and the moss and the warm rain that makes colanders of clouds and mist. Take me to the fires that burn out in the night, the embers dancing from the chimney to tangle with the stars. The green lights that flow like waves in the cold still air and the steam that rises from the tops of our heads as we stay warm in the winter. Take me to the lanterns rising into the black, wishes carried on flame and fabric, prayers to all the gods we have never seen. Take me to those high white peaks, to the colored flags climbing center poles and the breathless air we struggle to breathe. To the mantra painted rocks filling freezing streams the gentle hands weathered old. Take me to the swaying trains, the hands on the walls to keep our balance. the sleeper cars and sliding doors, the crumpled maps in reclined seat backs. —tyler knott gregson </p>

                  <p>It seems I lost myself Somewhere I’ve never been before, That my pieces kiss the sand Upon some unknown distant shore. I hear them softly falling For the chance to reunite, If home is where the heart is Then I have no home in sight. I know not where to find them, In which direction I shall start, Only that life appears a quest; An endless search for every part, And that the longer I stand still The more I surely slip away, So I must leave out of the fear Of what may happen if I stay —e.h. </p>

                  <p>They drove for hours to the ocean, Just for the proof that they had been, Then watched the sunset’s splendid colors, Through the pixels of a screen, Left before the sky had darkened, And the night had learnt their names, With their fingers tapping light, That would have put the moon’s to shame, Ten billion stars all tried to stop them, To beg that they should see more, Instead of sleeping in hotels, That boast the fact that they have four, But their only constellations, Were the cracks across their ceiling, As they sent their one-word answers, As a substitute for feelings, And with the traffic as a soundtrack, They soon drifted off to sleep, And didn’t even slightly stir, When all the clouds began to weep —e.h. </p>

Promise to stay wild with me.” —2/7, 16:14 </p>

With the fact that I would rather lie here alone and reach out to cradle the empty indention of where you once rested, than feel it filled and graze the heated and hollow skin of another? How can I measure the distance between us? Is it in minutes or miles or hours or the most minute of millimeters? When we kiss and the holo of our electrical fields, and the skin of our lips finally sink together, is it close enough then? Can I crawl through it and close my eyes on your side of the skin we wear? I just know that I would rather listen to your brand and timbre of silence than hear a thousand songs by a thousand choirs ringing through the vaulted and exalted ceilings of a thousand churches. Sing to me with your silence and I will feel it pulse against my eardrums like waves on a lonely shore. I will let it lull me and soothe me and fill the locks in me since I began.” </p>

                  <p>there’s a bottle beating back against rocky shores, a delicate enclosure keeping prisoner a letter of all the words held back. words that never thrived, and eventually, faded as they lingered on crumpled sheets, splattered about the cracks on the wall above our heads—the constellations in our ceilings, our own little night sky—traced skylines and stayed hidden in a little corner of a wall. There are moments when they yearn to have the taste of freedom lingering on their chapped lips, calling out to dry land to reach closer, to escape the displeased waves they fall deeper and deeper into. But the fear-my fear- of the sudden surge of pain that would be felt after they climb out of this dark abyss of theirs holds them back. They enrage the water that surrounds them, and are drawn back with the furious ebb of the ever growing tides freedom now sings for these words of mine. They flee from the crippling aura of darkness into warm citron rays. But these words are late, far too late. you’ve drawn back into a world farther away from my reach. a different sky looks down upon you, and the wind coasting down hills that my feet remain yet to mark, stretching stalks of flowers I haven’t yet caressed has never called away the heat from my skin. these words of mine call out to a darkening oasis; a letter sent to a sailor after he’s been swallowed by the ocean, a kiss settled on the cheek of a rotting corpse; I have come to a cross-roads whose paths lead into a dark greenwood. To have travelled this far in hopes of meeting a brighter sun, only to run into the arms of your absence spawns a bewildering pain, much greater than what was once felt. And I feel a hundred more bottles springing up from the waters, more remnants of anguish scribbled on every corner of the sheet rolled up within their glass walls. And I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to hold them back; they will flood my very being until there’ll be nothing to do but set them free and welcome rushing waves of torment. Maybe one day these words will find their way to you. </p>

                  <p>Deep in the serenity of the night when the delicate touch of the wind puts chaos to rest, what do those who thrive along with the moon and its silver freckles in the sky say of the silence that lingers in the cold? Will their skin prickle at the darkness that holds them too close? Will their bones echo out songs of despair and cry out at the urge to let it out when it all becomes too much to bear? Or will this quiet be in their favor and cocoon them in warmth, even if temporary, drying out the waves of misery that drown them each night. How they wished there wasn’t a dark side to moments like this, that immediately the moon appeared in the sky and the sun carefully sank into the abyss of the sea, all their worries and pieces of unhappiness, however little, would simply disappear with the light. That they’d never have to walk along the riverbed of regret, or find themselves in the forest of reminisce, or lost in the vineyards of uncertainty, but skyrocket into the creases of dark space until morning comes again. </p>

                  <p>She started writing notes and keeping them under her pillow, and then she started writing them on her pillowcase, hoping they would help her have better dreams. And if she couldn’t sleep, she could just read them and be reminded of something so stunningly beautiful that her heart would swell and her bones would sigh and for just a second, the world would not seem like it was going to crush her. — Emily Brontë </p>

                  <p>Tell me a love story of yours; and not the kind that you regret. Not the one that left splinters in your heart that grew to become thorns as you held onto a home that had flown away from you. Tell me of the love that raises the corners of your lips as you flip through the memories like a moving gallery. Of a love that keeps you hoping, a love that draws out little ponds from your eyes, and not waterfalls. Perhaps the kind of love felt between a mother and child, between family, between friends. how lucky you must have felt to have them around whenever their presence healed the wounds underneath your skin. Let me know that even with the right person, everything could go wrong. Tell me of the words left unsaid, the pieces of the story left to fade away. There are paradises scribbled between lines and across margins, over and under places they do not belong, and to leave them in the dust would be to have tasted only quarter of of the good pieces to this darkness. Say something to me. Quieten this silence of yours. Fill these empty spaces with your words, no matter how insignificant you claim them to be. I once tasted too much of the universe that lingered on your lips, consumed more than I planned of those woven around your words, and from the moment you sought out to find a new home, I wilt from thirst. And when it comes to you, I’m at a loss for words. my greatest treasures melt into the nothingness as you approach me like a tornado in May; so sudden, so unexpected. except light and life don’t depart at your homecoming, and the nirvana I melt myself in has never felt a presence more familiar. </p>

                  <p>what is it you feel when you speak of the wind and the way it dances about the earth as it settles airy kisses on every piece of nature that comes her way, moving softly about the foliage of large sycamores, twisty mangroves and shady rain trees, whispering a lullaby to the silver moon thriving in the evening sky. Do you find it all beautiful, how, just like nature, we bundle everything in beauty in one moment and become pieces of one big storm cloud the next? Do you stay close to the beams of the moon and the sound of chaotic waves yet look, with pitiful eyes, at the clouds and rays of the sun, the mountains, the sand between your toes, the branches holding the leaves you never hesitate to admire, the fireflies frolicking, the caterpillar hiding between the stretching blades of grass because they never get enough love? </p>

                  <p>What would I say? What would I tell them what happiness will mean? What sorrow can taste like? Will I tell them that nothing on this earth will ever feel as much like home, as much like grace and as much like pure and absolute contentment than being woken in the stillness of a dark night, rolling over, adjusting your pillow and without warning, feeling the side of your foot brush the warmth of a leg that connects to a hip, a hip that gives way to a stomach and supports a chest, a chest that protects a heart that you know, without doubt, belongs to you. That happiness is handing over your heart, knowing that it is in capable hands; hands that want to hold it and will not tremble at the sight of it leaking out and spilling onto their clothes. That love, true love, is not seeing flaws in them, but explanations and reasons and meanings to the things they hide and spend so much time concerned over. It’s loving the pieces they waste their moments hiding. What would be written of sorrow? Why don’t they explain the emptiness that comes when one hand fills the gap and it belongs to one person that you waited a lifetime to find and that finding doesn’t mean getting them, and loving them doesn’t mean holding them, and holding them doesn’t mean keeping them, and waiting doesn’t mean you will wait numb to the loneliness and oxygen stealing burning of tired lungs? Why don’t they tell us of the wounds we will incur and the depth they will sink into us, and why don’t they tell us that we will forever cherish the stars created? —tyler knott gregson </p>

                  <p>there’s a chaos in longing, something lost in every patchwork of memory threaded together to stand in for what we no longer hold on to, a darkness in bringing back to life what burned nearly every fragment of hope left in our worn out bodies. A sense of vulnerability that quietly sinks in at the thought of being harmed by a mere spark of reminisce, the deathly stillness at the thought of having nothing but a memory to cling to…I can’t pinpoint the moment darkness settled, the moment we stepped into the sun and quietly withered underneath the light we held on to for far too long. There’s a world, however belittled, that exists between us, certain phases in time that can never be forgotten. but there are fragments of it that aren’t for forever, quietly fading away by the minute. And deep within that sense of freedom felt at the thought of it, there is also a sinking feeling that exists, tireless waves of unhappiness at the thought of having nothing cling to, of losing every treasured minute to the dust. </p>

                  <p>The inner life has its soft and gentle beauty; an abstract formlessness as well as a subtle charm. I often consider myself as a figure in a foggy painting: faltering lines, insecure distances, and a merging of greys and blacks. An emotion or a mood, a mere wisp of color, is shaded off and made to spread until it becomes one with all that surrounds it. </p>

                  <p>there is something mocking about the cracking of winter’s ice and the sudden burst of light that comes with the waking season. Something dispiriting about the clearing of the frost-layered earth and silvery trees, the parting of the snowflake-sky and wintry breeze. As if the earth’s moved on and left me behind, still staggering in snowstorms of yesterdays, while she clears away the silver mists of the winter and makes lush jungles of her prairies again; asters and lilies rooting up from her crevices, flush, fresh leaf buds growing on the once bare and brittle branches of the once dead trees. And there comes the summer of sun, endless weeks of golden light and warmth stepping forth from Birth. The same sun that sent new green leaves bursting from blackened buds now turn the wands of knee high grasses golden. Yet, she bores down on me hotter and harder than before, as if mocking me of the little light left inside of me, a striking difference to the infinite beams she holds–she is. A striking difference to the fresh earth and cloudless, brightened blue sky </p>

                  <p>But Fall comes forth and gives a soft knock, delicately setting the earth in graceful, warm fires, and there are those moments of wholeness at the sight of the grace in her crispness, the magnificence of her withering. As if the earth grew solemn from my distress and thought it necessary to reveal the beauty in the struggle; murky red sunsets flaming in smoky crimson, maple trees turning vividly in hues of muted yellow and reds softly singing words of comfort in september winds—nature’s violently hued calling before the white silence of the winter…Nothing could surpass the warmth of autumn’s touch, the feeling of comfort and belonging in her fiery embrace. Yet, like all other things cherished, the moment of her parting arrives as swiftly as the streams running clear in the summer woods; within a passing of the wind, the last leaves are called off their branches, and the november winds give their last dance. And I am overwhelmed by a longing for her presence the moment the silvery deadness of the winter comes to leave the earth bare. </p>

I dream of laying naked in them, with a smile —a real smile— painting my face, painting my skin in the sun’s sweet, warm gold. then those woods, another little kingdom I would be more than happy to be lost in for eternity, because I’ve never travelled in a place brimming with so much life. they say there’s a secret garden there, with a pond and a swing; my eyes water at the absence of my fingerprints significantly staining them all, proof of my presence. I wish to bury my toes in the dirty black soil, trace my fingers over the bark of the trees, sigh at the sound of the birds tweeting in the leaves…I can only imagine how much warmth and peace awaits me. and I can stay here no longer. I must leave here at once, I must! or I believe I shall perish soon. I am afraid of dying out of deep sadness and boredom, and, when I return to the soil, discover that I have not lived. </p>

                  <p>For love is by definition an unmerited gift: being loved without meriting it is the very proof of real love. If a woman tells me : I love you because you’re intelligent, because you’re decent, because you buy me gifts, because you don’t chase women, because you do the dishes, then I’m disappointed: such love seems a rather self-interested business. How much finer it is to hear: I’m crazy about you even though you’re neither intelligent nor decent, even though you’re a liar, an egotist, a bastard. </p>

But the bravest man amongst us if afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of pleasure, or the luxury of regret. The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also. You, Mr. Gray, you with your rose-red mouth and rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—“ </p>

                  <p>there are some moments, usually on the most inactive and weary of days, when my mind wanders back to the peaceful eighteenth century; I stand beside a weeping willow on a golden-lit Wednesday afternoon, watching intently at a shape in the distance, planted on bare, breathing brown earth. his eyes: a midday starry sky, gleaming with intense admiration as they pick on every bend, curve, curl and imperfection on the supernova bursting around him. how could anything be so beautiful, so heart-hammering? he questions himself, the running man whose print sonnets and lullabies to him. he reaches for his brush, his stained palette, and the small fabric canvas hidden within the red poppies he sits in. who would have thought a simple tool—a stick with hair strands—a non-living object—could breathe out such life, such light? —daydreaming about Claude Monet </p>

                  <p>You are a mirror, so you mirror. Show me who I am, where I come from, and where I intend to take you—as if you have no legs of your own. No sense of direction. No light. No aptitude. No form. No shape of your own—you are water. And you have taken me to be your vessel. But I see you. I see you be me, and give me back what I give you. Hand me lines I tell you in my dreams. Promise me love that you expect from me—you think you are heavy. But you are heavy with my burden. You reflect my own light back at me and there is not a lot of which I own. It is always dark when we kiss. Eyes closed with surrender. Only pause and hesitance. Indecision in me is indecision in you. Cravings in me are cravings in you. No desire of your own. Only banality. Only want. To show what is seen. To be what is needed. To talk what needs to be said. Only cause and no effect. Only battle and no blood shed. Only dying and death. Only prosecution. Only pain. Only reflection. Only shame. </p>

                  <p>The difference between men and other things is only in the largeness and variety of man’s capacities; and in this special capacity, that he alone has the power of observing the circumstances favorable to his own growth, and can apply them for himself, yet, again, with this condition,—that he is not, as is commonly supposed, free to choose whether he will make use of these appliances or not. When he knows what is good for him, he will choose it; and he will judge what is good for him by the circumstances which have made him what he is. </p>

                  <p>I can take no more of this damnation; release me! release me from this peril! I dive headfirst into a paradise; a mere illusion. what envelopes me now is this vacuum, this emptiness. I have longed for eons the absence of life, yet now that it wallows down my blood tunnels and springs out of my fingers, I yearn for its departure. I yearn for the sun, the moon, the stars, for life and light—be it little, rare—to be pounded down with mortal faults and problems; to wail to golden rays and crystal light about the love that I have been deprived of. not this. not this blazing, fatal inferno </p>

                  <p>“How frequently do you look in the mirror? Does your face please you? Are you disgusted to detect familial features? Do you worship or hate your ancestors? Do you consider your image erotic? Do you pretend that you are a star’s child? If you squint, does your reflection become abstract? Is abstraction a transcendental escape from identity or a psychotic spasm of depersonalization?” </p>

                  <p>man, when he does not find meaning, molds satisfactory “answers” that would best fit the slip carved out from his own fingers. what we say are revelations are simply ideologies of our own species; living beings as deprived and hindered as we are. and yet, we cling to them as if they’ve been sent down from the ethereal residence of the gods, like weekly telegraphs either strengthening of changing our judgement, causing the rise or fall of a people— I speak as though I am not a sinner. </p>
