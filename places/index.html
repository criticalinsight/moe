To the sand covered shores and tide poles that hold the sea, to the sea that holds the moon and he starts that fall until you sleep. Take me to our shared slumber on scratchy sheets starched too stiff. Take me to the cheap hotels and take me to palaces we’ll never afford. Take me to the nights that never end, the lost and wander worn feet that collapse into bed as the sun is rising. Take me to the early evenings, tired legs sleeping sound before the sun falls below the hills. Take me our places, the creaking floors and our boots making songs stop them. The dim lit pubs and fiddle dances, the globe lights low, the hour long talks, the quiet romances. Take me down the old dirt roads, the rocks walls and clover greases. To the green and the grey to the blue and the white. Take me to our places, the stones and sticks in green hills. Take me to the rooftops made of earth. The heather and the moss and the warm rain that makes colanders of clouds and mist. Take me to the fires that burn out in the night, the embers dancing from the chimney to tangle with the stars. The green lights that flow like waves in the cold still air and the steam that rises from the tops of our heads as we stay warm in the winter. Take me to the lanterns rising into the black, wishes carried on flame and fabric, prayers to all the gods we have never seen. Take me to those high white peaks, to the colored flags climbing center poles and the breathless air we struggle to breathe. To the mantra painted rocks filling freezing streams the gentle hands weathered old. Take me to the swaying trains, the hands on the walls to keep our balance. the sleeper cars and sliding doors, the crumpled maps in reclined seat backs. —tyler knott gregson ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Moe"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Moe"}}</script>
